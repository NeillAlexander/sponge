    <h1>Sponge</h1>
    Sponge provides similar functionality to SoapTrace / SoapUI. Configure your application
    to route all Soap requests to Sponge, and configure Sponge to forward the requests
    to the server that will respond to them. Sponge will keep a record of all the Soap
    request / responses (known as 'exchanges') which you can inspect.
    <p>
      Once you have recorded some exchanges you can then tell Sponge to replay them i.e.
      when a this request comes in, replay this exchange. In this way you can specify
      which response to return for each request type.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intention is to use Sponge during development / debugging so that you can always
      use the same data, and not be reliant on a back end server.
    </p>
    <h2>Configuration</h2>
    On the configuration screen you can specify the port Sponge listens on for incoming
    requests, and the url of the server it will redirect to. Note that Sponge will
    automatically generate the call to the correct Soap method. You should simply
    supply the server url.
    <p>
      i.e. http://someserver:1234 rather than http://someserver:1234/soap-method.asmx
    </p>
    <p>
      Sponge automatically appends the correct soap method.
    </p>
    <h2>Modes</h2>
    <h3>Replay or Forward</h3>
    In this mode Sponge will first look for an exchange to replay for every request
    received. If it finds a replay exchange, it returns the response for that exchange.
    If no replay is found then the request if forwarded to the server.
    <p>
      This is the default mode.
    </p>
    <h3>Forward All</h3>
    In this mode Sponge just works as a router, forwarding all requests on to the
    configured server.
    <h3>Replay or Fail</h3>
    If no replay exchange is found, then an exception is thrown.
    <h2>Resending Requests</h2>
    It is also possible to use Sponge as a source of requests for a back end server. When
    you have a Sponge session loaded, simply configure Sponge to point to the Soap service
    you want to test, then select the row of the request you want to send, and hit 's'
    to send the request again (or right click on the row and select 'Resend').
    <h2>Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>
    These shortcuts will work when the exchange table has keyboard focus (i.e. the top panel).
    <ul>
      <li>l = label</li>
      <li>u = unlabel</li>
      <li>d = duplicate row</li>
      <li>x = delete row</li>
      <li>r = replay</li>
      <li>s = send request again</li>
      <li>p = pack table (i.e. reformat to fit contents)</li>
    </ul>
    There are also shortcuts for the menu items (see the menus for details).
