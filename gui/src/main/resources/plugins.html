    <h1>Plugins</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    Sponge supports simple plugins that allow you to manipulate the soap request
    or response xml. To create a new plugin you need to do the following:
    <ol>
      <li>Start a new project and add a reference to the plugin module</li>
      <li>Create a class that extends either com.nwalex.sponge.plugin.RequestPlugin or
      com.nwalex.sponge.plugin.ResponsePlugin</li>
      <li>Add a resource called plugin.properties to define the plugin classes</li>
      <li>Build the jar and place in the plugins directory</li>
      <li>Restart Sponge</li>
    </ol>
    You should then see your plugin in the Plugins menu. Select it to enable it.
    <p/>
    Both request and response plugins get the soap xml. You can use whatever you want
    to transform this, then return the xml that you want to send. If you don't want to
    transform the xml, simply return the text that was passed into the method (see
    sample code below).
    <h2>Sample Code</h2>
    The code from the demo plugin is included in the $SPONGE_HOME/src directory.
